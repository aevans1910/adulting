## Adulting is a forum for crowd-sourced information on how to be an adult.

⚠️ ⚠️ Disclaimer: This web application is a group project and is still in development. 
Originally, we were going to connect the Node.js back end to a React front end, 
but the conversion proved too complex given our paucity of understanding, and 
the time contstraints. 
The plan is to revisit and upgrade the app this way eventually.

We also plan to Dockerize it and add it to a CapRover droplet on Digital Ocean for 
continuous deployment.⚠️ ⚠️

#### Rationale

There are many assumptions about knowledge and skill sets based on age, but no effective 
way for individuals or communities to share their advancements in the performance of adulthood 
with the whole world.

People need a forum for sharing individual and communal education about adulting knowledge and skills. 

*Adulting* provides a Reddit-like forum for users to share and learn all kinds of knowledge,
from common knowledge to tips and hacks. Together, we can evolve.


#### Description

Users can post questions, respond to others, and upvote or downvote responses. 

They can also seach their posts and sort posts by category.


Frameworks: Node.js, Handlebars.js
